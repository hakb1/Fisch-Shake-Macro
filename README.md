the key to go down may be different to you - i use s - you can edit which key you want in the code - use visual studio code or notepad to edit it

if it doesn't work - open terminal/command line - write "pip install keyboard" hit enter - try again

if you wish to edit the code feel free to do so - i suggest visual studio code.
